                <h2 id= "sunny" >Orlando Florida</h2>

                <p>My vacation to Orlando FL I really love vacationing in Orlando my sister Ann I would plan our
                    trip where we could all get a Ville That was large enough for the whole family could spend a week in
                    Orlando it&#39;s usually a fun vacation that is if we all can stand each other for a week with kids I really like
                    Orlando FL but I have to go before the middle of June because after that the weather is too hot and it is
                    a lot of things to do in Orlando besides going to the theme parks going to the theme parks is OK but the
                    crowds gets a little too much I think Orlando FL maybe the annual vacation destination now</p>

                <h2>Dallas Texas</h2>

                <p class="story">My vacation to Dallas TX was OK but I do not have to go back I love the skyline of Dallas at night
                    it&#39;s really beautiful at night but when the sun come up that&#39;s not a pretty picture I woke up one morning
                    in my hotel room about 4:00 AM and I will see the highway it was rush hour all day long and people
                    drive like maniac so Dallas was not my favorite place to go for a vacation and I forgot to mention the
                    tolls which I hate it so I&#39;m not a fan Dallas TX OK</p>
